# 1 - Network Accessible Log
In this exercise we'll be building a network exposed log structure. This means
that we'll create an HTTP server, which accepts arbitrary data and writes it to
a log.

## Task
Write an HTTP server that accepts arbitrary input and logs it to a file a
single line at the time. There is no need to escape or validate characters, as
we have full control over data input. Expose the server on port `8080`. Open
the file descriptor for the log at `/tmp/patterns-workshop.db`.  Respond with a
`200` status code when the data is accepted by the server.

## Tips
- Use [`http.createServer()`][createserver] to create an `http` server
- Streaming data from an incoming http request can be done using
  `req.pipe(destinationStream)`
- Use [`concat-stream`][concat-stream] from `npm` to concatenate the incoming
  data stream into a string before writing it to the file. Every line in our
  log must be terminated with a newline, so we need to append those manually to
  each incoming line.
- Writing lines to a file can be done by using
  [`fs.createWriteStream()`][fs-writestream] or
  [`fs.writeFile()`][fs-writefile]
- To make the write stream (or `writeFile` call) append, rather than override,
  pass [`{flags: 'a'}`][fs-append] as the second argument
- Don't worry about error handling structures quite yet, one thing at the time

## Testing
Run your application, write a few lines to it over HTTP and then check the
content has been succesfully written:
```sh
# run your app in a separate terminal
$ curl localhost:8080 -X POST -d "[$(date +'%s')] line 1"
$ curl localhost:8080 -X POST -d "[$(date +'%s')] line 2"
$ tail -f /tmp/patterns-workshop.db
```
