# Distributed Patterns Workshop
Hey there stranger, welcome to the distributed patterns workshop. In this
workshop we'll be creating a single-user, single-feed twitter application
exposed over the network - or in more computersciency terms: a network exposed
log structure.

Throughout this workshop we'll be using `node(1)`, `nanomsg` and `protobuf` to
create networked applications. We use these technologies because they happen to
work well together, but the patterns we discuss in this workshop can be
implemented using wildly different languages and technologies.

## Requirements
This workshop assumes you're running a recent-ish version of Node (`>=3.0`) and
are comfortable with writing JS as we'll be focusing on concepts that move
beyond basic Node development. However, if you're not comfortable enough with
Node yet to finish the exeercises, reading through the workshop might still
prove to be useful as it will provide you with a set of solid practices.
