# 07 - sychronized pubsub

Order in distributed systems is a hard problem. When connecting multiple
systems there are no guarantees that the other system will be available when
you try to connect to it. So in order to do that it must be verified. Sometimes
people choose to use timers / timeouts before connecting, but the more reliable
option is to listen for events.

The sychronized pubsub combines multiple sockets to achieve this. It only
starts emitting data once it knows that there are listeners to send data to:

```txt
 ┌───────────┐
 │ Publisher │
 ├─────┬─────┤
 │ REP │ PUB │
 └▲──┬─┴──┬──┘
  1  │    │
  │  2    3
 ┌┴──▼─┬──▼──┐
 │ REQ │ SUB │
 ├─────┴─────┤
 │Subscriber │
 └───────────┘
```

## Exercise
Create a publisher in one file and a subscriber in another. Emit a number in
the fibonacci sequence every 500ms, but only if a subscriber is available.

## Tips
- remember that nanomsg sockets are blocking, if messages are not coming
  through it might be because of that

## Bonus
- implement multiple subscribers
- send a "disconnect" signal from the subscriber when it's closed
- send a heartbeat check from the publisher to validate if the subscriber is
  still up
- keep sent values in a cache, and only drop them off if the heartbeat to all
  children was ok
