# 06 - pubsub with channels

Sometimes messages need to be sent to multiple subscribers, but not all
subscribers are interested in all messages. Filtering messages can be done
using `channels`.

## Task
Create one publisher and two subscriber. `sub1` should listen on the channels
`foo` and `bar`. `sub2` should listen on the channels `beep` and `boop`. Every
`1000ms` 4 messages should be sent. Shen a sub receives a message, it should
echo the message prefixed by the name of the sub.

## Tips
- channels can be set by doing `sub.chan([<prefix>])`
- filterable messages can be sent by prefixing the message
