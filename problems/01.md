# 1 - REQRES
`REQUEST / RESPONSE` is the cornerstone of virtually every networked
application. A client calls a service, the service performs a computation and
sends data back.

In browser land this is often referred to as an "API call", which almost always
uses JSON as the encoding layer (JSON over HTTP/TCP). A browser talks to a
server, and a server sends data back.

In distributed systems land this is often referred to as Remote Procedure Call
(RPC, where "procedure" means "function"), which means servers call other
servers to perform tasks, and send the result back once they're done. This is
often also done using TCP, but opinions on which encoding layers to use differ
(e.g. JSON, msgpack, protobuf, capnproto).

A `REQRES` call can be visualized as:
```txt
    ┌──────────┐
    │  Client  │
    ├──────────┤
    │   REQ    │
    └──┬────▲──┘
       │    │
 Hello │    │ World
       │    │
    ┌──▼────┴──┐
    │   REP    │
    ├──────────┤
    │  Server  │
    └──────────┘
```

In this exercise we'll create a `REQRES` pair using `nanomsg`.

## Task
Create a `req`/`res` socket pair using `nanomsg`. Send the string `"hello"`
from `req`, and reply with `RPC` from `res`. Close both sockets once the call
is completed.
