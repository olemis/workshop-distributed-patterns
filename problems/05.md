# 05 - decode protocol buffers

Now that we've encoded a message, let's decode it!

## Task
Create a CLI application that takes the location for a message, reads it and
decodes it using the schema created in the previous exercise. Log the decoded
message to stdout.

## Tips
- if you hadn't already, you might want to save the schema created in the
  previous example as a `.proto` file
- catch errors using `try ... catch`
