# 04 - protocol buffers
Protocol buffers are a way of statically encoding messages as binary. This
means that they can be transferred over the network more efficiently. They can
also be versioned by incrementing the count for the value in the schema.
Protocol buffers are not bound to any particular transport.

An example schema for a company:
```protobuf
message Company {
  required string name = 1;
  repeated Employee employees = 2;
  optional string country = 3;

  message Employee {
    required string name = 1;
    required uint32 age = 2;
  }
}
```
Schemas are generally suffixed as `.proto`.

## Task
Create a CLI application that takes two arguments of "name" and "age" (argv 1,
2) and encodes them using a protocol buffer and save the encoded message to a
file (`user.message`).

## Tips
- Get the cli arguments using `process.argv`
- Writing to files is easiest using `fs.createWriteStream`
- Use the `protocol-buffers` library from npm
- Use `require('assert')` to validate the right arguments are passed
