# Distributed Patterns Workshop
Hey there stranger, welcome to the distributed patterns workshop. In this
workshop we'll be creating a single-user, single-feed twitter application
exposed over the network - or in more computersciency terms: a network exposed
log structure.

Throughout this workshop we'll be using `node(1)`, `nanomsg` and `protobuf` to
create networked applications. We just happen to use these technologies because
they work well together, but the patterns we discuss in this workshop can be
implemented using different languages and technologies.

## Requirements
This workshop assumes you're running a recent-ish and are comfortable with Node
version of Node (`>=3.0`), as we'll be focusing on concepts that move beyond
the basics. However, if you're not comfortable enough with Node yet to finish
the exeercises, reading through the workshop might still prove to be useful as
it will provide you with a set of solid practices.
