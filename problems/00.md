# Distributed Patterns Workshop
Hey there stranger, welcome to the distributed patterns workshop. In this
workshop we'll be going over different async models using `node(1)`, `nanomsg`
and `protobuf`. We use these technologies because they happen to work well
together, but the patterns we discuss in this workshop can be implemented using
wildly different languages and technologies.

## Requirements
This workshop assumes you're running a recent-ish version of Node (`>=3.0`) and
are comfortable with writing JS. Should you have any questions: there'll be
mentor(s) to help out, so don't hesitate to ask. Good luck!
